                            <p>By the time I met Bob Hamer at a University of Arizona networking event in the fall of 2014 I had already started reaching out to teams to gage job openings for the summer. Like many college students, I had a good amount of work experience and a solid GPA, but found it increasingly difficult to gain much traction on my own and without connections. Everything changed the day I decided to reach out to Bob for a consulting session. After learning about my work history and goals, Bob began reaching out to teams on my behalf. Within weeks, I had three in-person interviews set up with professional organizations around the country and landed the dream job I never thought was possible. I could not recommend Bob more and am lucky to be able to use him as a resource in the future.</p>

                            <p>I met with Bob Hamer one time before immediately thinking that a sit down over the phone would be extremely beneficial for my career. As a senior in college, I was looking for any type of “leg-up” I could get on my peers to find myself the best job. Bob had fantastic insight into the sports business world and with that came great advice that helped get my career started off right. Following our call, Bob used his network to help give me opportunities with amazing organizations that he felt best fit my personality and skill set. Through those opportunities, I was able to land a dream job right out of college! There is no doubt in my mind that Sports Business Solutions helped me a great deal my senior year, for that I cannot thank them enough. I look forward to working with them in the future!</p>

                            <p>If connections or a job in sports is your goal, then I have two words for you....Bob Hamer! I dreamed to be involved in sports, but as a freshman at the University of Arizona I had no connections. That's until I met Bob Hamer, the President of Sports Business Solutions, and now I have an internship with the NJ Devils. I can tell you from personal experience that a 30 minute consultation with Bob made my dreams of a sports internship come true. I would highly recommend contacting Bob so he can help put you on the fast track to the sports career of your dreams. Hard working, loyal, responsible, charismatic and driven are just few of the many traits that Bob embodies and I am forever grateful to have come into contact with him.</p>

The conversations I have had with Bob have truly opened my eyes and made working in sports a reality. After taking the time to get to know me and understand my situation, Bob was able to use his expansive network and knowledge of the industry to put me in contact with the right people. Within a few days, I had multiple interviews lined up with organizations I had only dreamed of working for! Bob helped me secure my internship and has allowed me to grow as an individual through his programs. I cannot thank Sports Business Solutions enough, and I look forward to working with them in the future.</p>

                            <p>I had the distinct privilege of getting to know Bob really well without ever meeting him. We connected through phone calls and emails and it was amazing to see how great of a coach he was even from afar. Bob provided me with many job opportunities in sports and I ended up having to make a decision on where I wanted to go. How cool is that! Not only did he help me progress in my career but he still teaches me many lessons through his webinars. If you have thought twice about his webinars just stop yourself and do it! Take genuine interest into everything Bob has to offer because he can help you catapult your career as he focuses on coaching and not just job placement.</p>

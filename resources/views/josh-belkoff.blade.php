            <p>Josh was born and raised in Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, about 30 minutes outside of Philadelphia. Growing up in the suburbs of PA, he played sports and enjoyed following the Philadelphia sports scene. After high school he attended the University of Arizona. Initially his focus was on Political Science as he thought he’d pursue the legal route after college. But shortly into his Junior year he shifted his focus to sports and took classes geared towards sports management. It turned out to be the perfect fit! In college Josh had various internships in sports which included: FC Tucson, the Tucson Padres, Arizona Diamondbacks, and the University of Arizona Athletic Department. However, after working at the Wildcat Club at U of A, which was the fundraising arm of Arizona Athletics, he found a passion for business development and realized that selling in sports was the career he wanted to pursue.</p>
            <p>As graduation neared he applied to various jobs in the industry, one of which was for a seasonal Sales Consultant job on the Phoenix Suns New Business Team. About eight weeks prior to graduation he got the chance to interview for the role. It was there where he met SBS Consulting Founder Bob Hamer. At the time, Bob was leading the Sales and Service team at the Suns. They interviewed Josh for the role and he got it. He accepted the position on the Phoenix Suns New Business Team and started in the Summer of 2012, right after graduation. </p>
            <p>In that role Josh focused on selling season tickets, group tickets, and premium hospitality for the NBA’s Phoenix Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury. After 6 months, he was promoted to an Account Executive, where he focused on selling new full season ticket memberships and premium hospitality. Josh excelled amongst his peers and had an unmatched passion for the industry. He wanted to be the best on his team and be looked at as one of the best in the industry. During his time as an Account Executive, he was #1 in both membership sales and new season ticket sales revenue. Shortly after that campaign, Josh was promoted to Team Leader of the New Business Team. In that role he was still selling, but also helped recruit, train and develop the entry level sales consultants. </p>
            <p>In June of 2014, only two years removed from his first day of employment at the Suns, he was promoted to the Manager of the New Business Development program, one of the fastest leadership ascensions in the departments history. He spent three seasons in that role, recruiting, training, leading, and developing the entry level sales consultants. During his tenure there, Josh grew the sales staff from 14 to 19 team members and helped more than 40 people get promoted to senior level positions in sports, with teams all over the country. </p>
            <p>In 2017 after three years managing the New Business Team, Josh was ready for a new challenge and was promoted to the Senior Manager of Premium Sales. In that role he oversaw the ticket sales strategy and renewal efforts for the Arizona Rattlers (IFL) football team, which grew new business by 12% and renewals grew to 91%. In that role Josh also created and executed the strategy to sell Phoenix Suns Premium Party Suites and Concert Suites for events happening at Talking Stick Resort Arena. While he wasn’t around to finish the campaign, the day he left they were tracking 134% to goal.</p>
            <p>Throughout his time at the Suns, Josh stayed in constant contact with Bob Hamer at SBS. Bob was one of his first and biggest mentors in the industry. When the opportunity arose to join his team at SBS Josh knew it was the perfect fit and the right next step for his career. As the Senior Director of Business Development at SBS, Josh sells and delivers sales training and consulting services to SBS’ growing portfolio of professional, minor league and college clients. At his core he’s committed to helping others achieve success in the industry, the same way he has over the last eight years both at the Suns and with SBS.</p>

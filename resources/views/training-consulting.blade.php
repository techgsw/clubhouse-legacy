                                <p>We had Bob out to San Diego after I transitioned into my new role overseeing the group department. His insights helped both the staff and myself set the tone for the upcoming season. Our staff benefitted most from the one-on-one settings where he could dive into each of their books of business and look for areas of opportunity. This coupled with his extensive background in the NBA and their group sales best practices really opened our reps eyes to what other programs are out there. For myself, getting an opportunity to spend time with Bob and talk through short and long term strategy, staffing and philosophy allowed me to focus on what was important for the 2015 season and beyond.</p>

What we found with Sports Business Solutions and Adam was someone who brought enthusiasm, new ideas, and a fresh perspective to how our ticket sales staff worked every day. Almost instantly our sales staff has been able to implement the tactics and tools he provided into their sales flow.</p>

                                <p>We decided to partner with Bob Hamer for our training needs because we felt there was great value in his hands-on experience as a past sports sales professional who worked his way from an entry sales rep to a leadership role as a Vice President. His experience brings credibility that separates him from other trainers and it is that credibility which created immediate buy-in from our staff. Bob has been conducting ongoing training with us over a long-term period of many months. We felt it was important for our reps to have constant and consistent sales training with the same facilitator in order to truly change behavior. The largest transformation has been with our staff’s approach to B2B selling. We began seeing immediate results after incorporating his training into our business campaign. Bob has been a valuable resource for our organization and will continue to be a key part of our training strategies in the future.</p>

He did a great job connecting with our staff.  He helped instill more confidence in our reps, especially on the B2B side. Our reps made more appointments in the month following training than they had made all year. We were impressed with the time Adam took to customize the training for our market and our staff.

                                <p>The A’s partnered with Bob, Jason, and SBS to support our ticket sales department expansion. Working with SBS and Jason specifically, he was able to provide us an extensive candidate pool to fill account executive roles on our group sales & business development team. Jason made the process easy from day 1 and we are very happy with the results. We will continue to work with SBS for our recruiting needs as they arise.</p>

                                <p>Not only did Jason provide us some great candidates, but he was transparent about the challenges that they were having in the market that made it easy for us to understand what was out there and what types of people were coming through our door. Jason allowed me to have as much involvement as I wanted during the process and was always there for check-ins, even just a quick "hello" at the end of the week to make sure everything was going okay. It really felt like we were all working as a team, and I would absolutely use this group (Jason, specifically) again.</p>

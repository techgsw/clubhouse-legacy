            <p>Kevin was born in Pittsburgh, PA and raised in Wellington, FL.  The son of a high school football and basketball coach, he enjoyed playing baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and golf growing up in South Florida.  He graduated from the University of Florida in 2003 with a degree in Television & Radio Broadcasting, however he found a passion for Sports Management while at UF.  That led him to pursue a Masters Degree in Sport Administration at Florida State University, where he graduated in 2005.</p>
            <p>While studying at FSU, Kevin completed an internship with the Pittsburgh Pirates during Spring Training in 2004 in Bradenton, FL.  He started his sports career with the Florida Panthers as an Inside Sales Representative in 2005 and was promoted to a New Business Development Account Executive after 4 months.  He went on to lead his peers in new business revenue in 2006 and 2007 with the Panthers before moving to Virginia.  It was there that he transitioned to multimedia corporate partnership sales with Virginia Tech IMG Sports Marketing.  Kevin found success generating new business and creating incremental revenue for the Hokies from 2008 to 2011.  With this experience he founded Division 3 Consulting, which focused on revenue generation and strategic advisement services provided to DII and DIII college and university athletics and development departments.  Kevin and his family relocated back home to the Wellington, FL area in 2012, where he managed major and national advertising accounts for the Sun Sentinel before becoming their Digital Sales Manager in 2015.  He returned to sports ticket sales in 2016 as the Premium Sales Manager for the Jacksonville Jaguars.  He led major sales efforts including club and premium seating stadium renovation projects, the launch of Daily’s Place Amphitheater and its premium seating offerings, and business development for events at TIAA Bank Field like the Rolling Stones No Filter Tour, the annual Florida v. Georgia football game, and the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl.  He was responsible for the coaching, training, and mentoring of seven ticket sales Account Managers, several of which have gone on to management positions in the sports industry.</p>
            <p>After 4 seasons with the Jaguars, Kevin resigned in December 2019 and chose to join forces with Bob and Sports Business Solutions.  Just like SBS’ founder Bob Hamer, he is passionate about the value that quality sales training provides, and his goal is to help grow and mold the next generation of sports sales rock stars.  Kevin brings a wealth of B2B sales coaching skills along with experience building highly engaged sales cultures that deliver results.  In his role as Sr. Director of Training & Development at SBS he provides sales training and consulting support to SBS’ vast portfolio of professional and collegiate clients and offers assistance where he can with SBS’ growing recruiting business.</p>

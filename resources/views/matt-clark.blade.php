            <p>Throughout Matt’s life he has always had a passion for coaching. At an early age that was alongside his dad on the baseball field, during college that was leading a group of middle and high school students as a sports coach, and in his professional career he’s had the opportunity to leave his mark on hundreds of business professionals during his time in management. His passion has always been coaching, training, and personal development and he is grateful to be on the Sports Business Solution team, and have the opportunity to reach an even larger audience.</p>
            <p>Matt’s mission is to inspire others as a positive role model so that they can become better versions of themselves. His inspiration typically comes from leading by example. His desire to be a positive role model has been rooted within him since childhood, as he is the oldest of four siblings. Matt grew up in the Poconos, an area in northeast Pennsylvania. There he spent the majority of his childhood around some type of field or court with his closest family and friends. His two biggest role models growing up were his parents who constantly preached the importance of making a decision that feels right in your gut, and when you do, always give it 110%.</p>
            <p>Matt has spent most of his professional career working for the San Diego Padres, splitting his time between running the Group Sales and Inside Sales departments. As the Director of Group Sales and Hospitality he spent the majority of his time leading business strategy and revenue generation, and as the Inside Sales Manager he was focused on the recruiting, training and development of entry-level sales reps. Prior to joining the Padres he spent three seasons working for the Cleveland Indians as a Group Sales Account Executive where he sold groups, hospitality spaces, and luxury suites. He got his start in San Antonio working for the Spurs Sports and Entertainment Group as an entry level sales consultant. </p>
            <p>Matt currently resides in San Diego, where he’s been since 2013. He lives with his beautiful wife Kayleigh and their adorable Boston Terrier “Pudge”. His wife is his biggest inspiration as she is not only a genuine and loving human being, but she owns her own skincare company as well (CLEARstem). </p>

            <p>Andrea St. Urbain (Smith) partnered with Sports Business Solutions in June of 2019, and serves as a Consultant for Premium Service & Retention. She brings two decades of experience to the group and her trainings are tailored toward service and hospitality, an area of the business that she is most passionate about. In addition, Andrea has her own business called Premium Sports Business Consulting, that specializes in strategies and special projects for companies and entrepreneurs looking for a competitive edge.</p>
            <p>After successfully building her consulting business, a mutual contact connected her to Bob Hamer, who was looking to expand the training portfolio for Sports Business Solutions. After a couple of conversations, they quickly realized they had similar goals and aspirations and decided it would be great for both sides to team up, in an effort to make an even bigger impact across the industry.</p>
            <p>St. Urbain most recently served as the Senior Director of Premium Services for AEG at STAPLES Center & Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles from 2013-2018. Andrea began her career as an intern with the NFL’s San Diego Chargers in 2003 and the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour in 2004.  By 2005, she joined the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks as the Community Relations Coordinator and after two seasons transitioned to Manager of Client Relations.  In 2007, she started at STAPLES Center as an Account Manager for Premium Services.  In 2010, she moved on to Petco Park to oversee suites and manage key corporate partnerships for MLB’s San Diego Padres. Four seasons later she returned to STAPLES Center to lead her previous department.</p>
            <p>Originally from Buffalo, NY, Andrea earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Sport Management from Cortland State University (SUNY), and captained the Women’s Volleyball Team. She was inducted into Frontier High School’s Wall of Fame in 2015 for her achievements as a three-sport athlete, and she currently serves as a Mentor in the WISE (Women in Sports and Events) Mentorship Program.</p>
            <p>She grew up, and still is, immersed in the world of sports and comes from a family of talent evaluators. Her father A.J. Smith was an Executive in the NFL for over 30 years and her brother Kyle Smith is the Director of College Scouting for the Washington Redskins. Andrea and her husband Noah, a Scout for the Chicago White Sox, reside in Southern California with their daughter Reese.</p>

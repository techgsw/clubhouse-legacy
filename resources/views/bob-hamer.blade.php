            <p>Bob was born in Orange County, CA and his passion for sports was evident at an early age. He played all organized sports growing up and baseball and basketball through high school. His playing days ended there, but he went on to pursue his college degree and attended the University of Arizona. He graduated cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in business management in 06'. He was very involved in college as a member of the Sports Marketing Association and Alpha Kappa Psi, the professional business fraternity. Through the connections that he made at the U of A, he secured job interviews with a variety of sports teams and worked internships with the Charlotte Bobcats and Arizona Diamondbacks.</p>
            <p>After graduation, Bob began his business career with the Phoenix Suns as an inside sales rep selling tickets to groups and individuals. After 2 1⁄2 months, he became the first of his training class to get promoted to an account executive role where he focused on selling group tickets. He identified himself as a leader amongst his sales peers with his strong work ethic, positive attitude, and the results he produced. He became a senior account executive and then the group sales manager, and eventually rising to the role of director of group sales at age 27, one of the youngest directors in the NBA at the time. After leading the Suns group sales team to #3 in the league in group tickets sold, he became director of all ticket sales, overseeing a staff of 35, and all season tickets, group tickets and the entry-level sales training program. He helped lead his team to a 25% increase in new season ticket revenue in the 2013–14 campaign and then took on the service and retention department as well. At age 30, he became the vice president of all ticket sales and service, overseeing a staff of 53 including 3 directors and 2 managers, once again becoming one of the youngest VPs in the league. Now responsible for renewals in addition to all new ticket plans and groups, Bob helped lead his team in 2014–15 to new heights. Although he left mid-campaign, they were on pace to grow their renewal business 50%, their new ticket plan business 167%, and their group sales business 38%.</p>
            <p>Bob achieved his goal of becoming a VP, and enjoyed individual and team success with the Suns during his 8-year tenure, but he was ready for a new challenge. In August 2014, he resigned his position as vice president with the Suns and founded Sports Business Solutions, LLC. His commitment at the helm of SBS is to help others achieve success in sports business. His passion has always been and always will be the people, and he’s looking forward to helping develop the next generation of sports industry leaders.</p>
